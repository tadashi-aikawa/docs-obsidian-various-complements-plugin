This command uses the currently entered query as an alias to display completion suggestions. For example, if you type "obs" and select the suggestion "Obsidian" with this command, it will become `[[Obsidian|obs]]`.

This feature is only available with [[Internal link complement]]. If you execute this command for suggestions other than [[Internal link complement]], it will behave the same as the usual "select".
